Adrenalin Scores, a more discerning and exciting way of delivering football scores!



User editing (Boot Room)
  - Edit Selected Leagues (Remove existing leagues / add additional leagues) English, Spanish and Serbian
  - Change Theme (grass, teletext and champ_man)
  
Leagues 
  - List leagues (England and Scotland)
  - List scores from a specific league


Currently, app shows leagues for England and Scotland and uses live api. Since there are no matches from monday to friday, I implemented mocked data. Flag for changing from live data to mocked (mockData) is in SportmonksApiCallProvider class.
